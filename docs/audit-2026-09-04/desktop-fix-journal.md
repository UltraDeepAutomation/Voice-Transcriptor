# Ultra-Audit · FIX · DESKTOP + REPO-PLUMBING

Rollback point: `main` at `889c91a` (baseline: `npm --prefix desktop test` = 153 pass, 0 fail).
Scope: `desktop/**`, `BUILD.command`, `INSTALL*.command`, `.github/**`, `.gitignore`.
Out of scope (other agents own them concurrently): `backend/`, `frontend/`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `BUGS_AUDIT*`.

## Commit 1 — `a152ec7` · power/lifecycle wiring

**IDs:** D-001 (P0), D-076 (P2), D-075 (P2).

**Files:** `desktop/power-events.js` (new), `desktop/power-events.test.js` (new),
`desktop/main.js`, `desktop/ipc-contract.test.js`, `desktop/package.json`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes — the two `powerMonitor.on`
blocks were still inside `restoreShortcutsAfterCaptureAbort` at HEAD `889c91a`.

**Verification**
- Guard fails before / passes after (brace-matched body of the abort handler,
  run against `git show HEAD:desktop/main.js`):
  ```
  OLD main.js: restoreShortcutsAfterCaptureAbort body contains powerMonitor: true
  OLD main.js: ... contains notifyRendererSystemSuspend: true
  ```
  i.e. the new `ipc-contract.test.js` assertion would have failed on the
  pre-fix source. After the fix the whole suite is green.
- D-075 proof (synthetic leak `exposeInMainWorld("bad", { raw: ipcRenderer })`):
  ```
  old regex catches raw-ipcRenderer leak: false
  new scan catches raw-ipcRenderer leak: true
  ```
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 159 / pass 159 / fail 0` (was 153).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.
- `desktop/package.json` `build.files` now lists `power-events.js`
  (`packaging.test.js` passes, which is what proves the packaging graph).

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* extract the event -> action mapping into a pure module rather than
  moving the loose statements up to `whenReady`. A move alone would have left
  the same untestable shape that hid the bug for two releases; the module is
  what the required source-level + pure-module tests attach to.
- *Chosen:* idempotent subscribe (WeakSet on the monitor) even though the new
  call site runs once — the accumulation bug (N aborts -> N re-registrations)
  must be impossible by construction, not by call-site discipline.
- *Chosen:* handler failures are caught **inside** the per-event callback and
  logged. This is not catch-and-ignore: it is containment at an OS callback
  boundary, and it is what stops a failing shortcut re-claim from suppressing
  the warm-capture release. The failure is logged with its message.
- *Rejected:* keeping `for (const reason of ["suspend", "lock-screen"])` and
  simply re-indenting it — the shadowing of the enclosing `reason` parameter and
  the source-string-matching test would both have survived.

## Commit 2 — `317b4ca` · Windows paste decoding & the paste wire protocol

**IDs:** D-002 (P0), D-032 (P2), D-016 (P2, SSOT), D-033 (P2, SSOT).

**Files:** `desktop/child-io.js` (new), `desktop/child-io.test.js` (new),
`desktop/paste-protocol.js` (new), `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/paste-result.js`,
`desktop/paste-result.test.js`, `desktop/paste-script.js`,
`desktop/paste-verification-policy.js`, `desktop/package.json`.

**Re-verified on current code:** yes — `runCommand("cscript", [... "//U" ...])`
and the unconditional `setEncoding("utf8")` were both still present.

**Verification**
- New `child-io.test.js` encodes the exact wire bytes `cscript //U` writes
  (BOM + UTF-16LE `OK:vbs-paste\r\n`) and asserts both directions:
  ```
  the old UTF-8 decode  -> isVbsPasteSuccess === false   (the bug)
  the declared UTF-16LE -> isVbsPasteSuccess === true    (the fix)
  ```
  The old `paste-result.test.js` case fed a hand-typed UTF-8 string, a shape the
  pipeline cannot produce, which is why it was green on a broken pipeline; the
  replacement goes through `childStreamEncoding` + `StringDecoder`.
- A split-chunk case is covered too (a UTF-16LE code unit straddling two
  chunks), because `setEncoding` on the stream is what makes that work.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 171 / pass 171 / fail 0`.
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.
- `packaging.test.js` green with `child-io.js` and `paste-protocol.js` added to
  `build.files` (it fails without them — observed).

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* keep `//U` and decode as UTF-16LE, per the charter's tie-breaker
  ("keeps Cyrillic-safe error text"). Dropping `//U` would make the ASCII
  markers work but leave cscript's own error text (which can carry a Cyrillic
  user path) in the OEM code page, read as UTF-8 -> mojibake.
  *Rejected:* a per-call `stdoutEncoding` option — that is a second place the
  flag and the decode could drift apart. The encoding is derived from the
  command line, so it cannot.
- *Chosen:* `desktop/paste-protocol.js` as the marker SSOT rather than making
  `paste-result.js` require `paste-script.js` (the report's suggestion). The
  Windows VBS in main.js now needs `SENT:` too, and a generic parser depending
  on the macOS script builder is the wrong direction.
- *Chosen:* give the VBS branch the same receipt semantics as macOS instead of
  raising its timeout. A larger budget would only move the window.

## Commit 3 — `1d9fda2` · signing / release

**IDs:** D-003 (P0), D-020 (P1), D-021 (P1), D-022 (P1), D-023 (P1), D-024 (P1),
D-025 (P1), D-038 (P2), D-057 (P2), D-058 (P2), D-062 (P2), D-080 (P2).

**Files:** `desktop/scripts/macos-signing-utils.js`, `desktop/scripts/sign-mas.js`,
`desktop/afterPack.js`, `desktop/afterAllArtifactBuild.js`,
`desktop/entitlements.mac.plist` (new, strict), `desktop/entitlements.mac.inherit.plist`
(new, strict), `desktop/entitlements.mac.selfsigned{,.inherit}.plist` (renamed from
the old relaxed ones), `desktop/entitlements.mas.plist`, `desktop/package.json`,
`desktop/signing.test.js` (new), `BUILD.command`.

**Re-verified on current code:** yes — `const signIdentity = kind === "executable" ? identity : "-";`
and both copies of `DEFAULT_INTERNAL_SIGNING_IDENTITY` were present at HEAD.

**Verification**
- Pre-fix argument builder, replayed from `git show 889c91a:.../macos-signing-utils.js`:
  ```
  OLD dylib args: ["--force","--sign","-","/tmp/numpy/_core/_multiarray_umath.so"]
  OLD dylib signed ad-hoc: true
  OLD dylib has hardened runtime: false
  OLD dylib timestamped: false
  ```
  The new `signing.test.js` asserts the exact opposite for both `executable`
  and `dylib`, so it fails on the old code and passes now. This is the
  `codesign -dvv` expectation expressed as a test of the argument builder —
  notarization itself cannot be run here (no Developer ID certificate).
- `git show 889c91a:desktop/entitlements.mac.plist | grep -c disable-library-validation`
  -> `1`; the new public profile asserts 0 and the self-signed profile asserts 1.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 185 / pass 185 / fail 0` (was 171).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.
- `bash -n BUILD.command` -> OK. `plutil -lint` OK on all six plists.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* keep `identity: null` in package.json and make the hooks READ
  `build.<platform>.entitlements/entitlementsInherit/extendInfo`. Removing
  `identity: null` would hand signing back to electron-builder, which is exactly
  what afterPack.js documents at length that it must not do.
- *Chosen:* the entitlements profile follows from the identity
  (`resolveSigningPlan().entitlementsProfile`), with the self-signed variant
  derived by one rule (`selfSignedEntitlementsPath`) rather than a second list of
  filenames.
- *Chosen:* no built-in default identity in the hooks, and `BUILD.command` names
  the internal identity once so the repository owner's one-click build keeps
  working while any other machine gets an actionable error instead of a failure
  inside a hook. *Rejected:* leaving the default in the hooks (the report's
  D-023 finding) and *rejected:* removing it everywhere (would break the
  owner's daily build with no benefit the explicit name does not give).
- *Chosen:* `hasSigningIdentity` matches exactly, and a `security` failure is
  raised rather than reported as "identity absent" — the old behaviour told a
  user who had set the variable correctly to go and set it.

**Not done in this commit**
- **D-061** (release/ holds three full copies, ~750 MB): the internal zip is not
  dead weight — `INSTALL_ON_OTHER_MAC.command` falls back to it when a
  quarantined DMG will not mount, and reads its name from the release manifest.
  Which artifacts a release ships is a product decision with no test or lock
  file implying an answer, so the false comment was corrected and the artifact
  set left alone. Recorded as a human-decision item.
- Notarization itself could not be exercised (no Developer ID certificate in
  this environment); the Developer ID entitlements profile is reasoned from
  Apple's library-validation rule (a real Team ID is non-empty and now shared by
  every bundled Mach-O) and needs one real notarized build to confirm.

## Commit 4 — `22c6e3d` · paste verification & clipboard restore

**IDs:** D-004 (P1), D-056 (P2), and the policy half of D-004
(`paste-verification-policy` no longer disables on an early read).

**Files:** `desktop/paste-script.js`, `desktop/paste-script.test.js`,
`desktop/paste-result.js`, `desktop/paste-result.test.js`,
`desktop/paste-verification-policy.js`, `desktop/paste-verification-policy.test.js`,
`desktop/paste-capability.js`, `desktop/main.js`.

**Re-verified on current code:** yes. And re-verification found a SECOND,
deeper cause the discovery report did not have: the read itself was broken.

**Verification — measured live on macOS 27, not reasoned**
- Root cause A, `count of` on an attribute specifier (scratch TextEdit doc
  holding "abcde"):
  ```
  inline_count=1  value_first_count=5
  ```
  `count of (value of attribute "AXValue" of axElem)` inside a
  `tell application "System Events"` counts specifier ELEMENTS, not string
  characters. Both reads returned 1 for every readable value, so no paste
  could verify even with a settle delay, and `AXNumberOfCharacters`
  (which returned 5 correctly) was unreachable behind the `axLen is -1` guard.
- Root cause B, settle: with counting corrected, polling every 50 ms after a
  synthesised keystroke, 8 trials: `polls=1` every time.
- End-to-end A/B, running the REAL generated handlers from each version of
  `paste-script.js` in the same harness against a scratch TextEdit document:
  ```
  pre-fix  (889c91a): t1..t5  before=1 after=1  tag=:unverified
  post-fix          : t1..t5  before=0 after=5  tag=:verified
  ```
  Nothing was pasted into another app: the harness uses `keystroke`, and the
  document is closed without saving.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 189 / pass 189 / fail 0` (was 187),
  including the two osacompile suites, which do run here (macOS).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* poll (4 x 50 ms, exit on match) rather than a fixed sleep — per the
  charter, and because it makes the common case (50 ms) cheaper than the 160 ms
  sleep that was removed, while bounding the pathological one.
- *Chosen:* the element is resolved ONCE and the polls reuse it. The expensive
  read is `AXFocusedUIElement` (measured 20 s+ against Finder unbounded);
  re-resolving per poll would have blown the budget.
- *Chosen:* three verification outcomes (`:verified` / `:unverified` /
  `:unreadable`) instead of two, and a matching `INCONCLUSIVE` policy outcome.
  Collapsing "no readable value" with "growth did not match" is what let a
  merely slow target be treated like a mute one.
  *Rejected:* leaving the policy alone and relying on the read fix — the early
  read was only one way to produce a mismatch.
- *Chosen:* `verificationAllowanceMs` 1500 -> 3300, derived from the bound the
  reads can now actually reach, and the derivation written into the table.
  Darwin worst case is ~24.8 s, still inside `PASTE_POST_STOP_DEADLINE_MS` (32 s).

**Not done in this commit**
- D-031 (`bundleId` never supplied, so the verification key is a display name):
  needs an extra Apple Event on the capture path to fetch the bundle id.
  Deferred to the P2 pass.

## Commit 5 — `86d63d3` · permissions, auto-send, activation & the paste budget

**IDs:** D-005 (P1), D-006 (P1), D-007 (P1), D-008 (P1), D-019 (P1), D-039 (P2),
D-047 (P2), plus a companion of D-006 the report did not list (the PowerShell in
`activateAppByPid` and `activateAppByName` also discarded `SetForegroundWindow`'s
own result and printed "1" regardless).

**Files:** `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/paste-capability.js`,
`desktop/paste-capability.test.js`.

**Re-verified on current code:** yes, all five.

**Verification (pre-fix behaviour replayed from `889c91a`)**
```
trigger fires for "paste-capability-untrusted" -> false        (D-005)
planModifierRelease(win32, Control+Alt+Shift+V) -> needed:false (D-008)
worst case, activation uncounted: darwin 19435 win32 19890 linux 18360 (D-019)
```
Honest worst case after counting activation + probe + spawn allowance, and after
sizing:
```
darwin 26435   win32 28230   linux 29160   (deadline 32000, all inside)
```
Before the re-sizing the honest numbers were darwin 26435 / win32 64890 /
linux 36360 — i.e. the existing "worst case fits the deadline" test had been
passing on a model, not on the system.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 191 / pass 191 / fail 0` (was 189).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* one classifier (`classifyPastePermissionFailure` in
  `paste-capability.js`, returning a `PASTE_PERMISSION_ROUTE`), consumed by the
  prompt trigger, the dialog route and the two status-badge functions.
  *Rejected:* just adding the two new reasons to `looksLikeAutomationPermissionError`
  — that leaves two ladders that can drift again.
- *Chosen:* auto-send makes exactly ONE attempt. Neither `keystroke` nor
  `key code` reports whether the target acted, so a second chord would be a
  guess reported as a result. `key code 36` for the same layout-independence
  reason the paste uses `key code 9`.
- *Chosen (product-shaped, forced by the arithmetic):* Windows `maxAttempts`
  3 -> 2. With the activation ladder counted, three attempts cannot fit the
  32 s post-stop deadline at any per-spawn bound that PowerShell + Add-Type can
  actually meet. Two attempts still means four injections.
  *Rejected:* raising `PASTE_POST_STOP_DEADLINE_MS` — that is the envelope the
  user waits in, and §6.4 sets it deliberately.
- *Chosen:* Linux activation bound 5000 -> 1200 ms (wmctrl/xdotool compile
  nothing on the way in); Windows 5000 -> 2500 ms.

## Commit 6 — `966bcf7` · recording lifecycle & backend restart

**IDs:** D-014 (P1), D-017 (P1), D-018 (P1), D-030 (P2), D-037 (P2), D-040 (P2),
D-042 (P2), D-043 (P2), D-044 (P2), D-046 (P2), D-048 (P2).

**Files:** `desktop/main.js`.

**Re-verified on current code:** yes, all of them.

**Verification**
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 191 / pass 191 / fail 0`.
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.
- D-037 rendered output checked directly:
  `cd ~/Downloads/Voice\ Transcriptor && ./INSTALL.command` (was
  `Voice\\ Transcriptor`, which a shell reads as a literal backslash).
- D-030: `grep -n "broadcastEngineStatus\|engine:status" desktop/main.js` now
  matches only the comment explaining why there is no push channel.
- **No unit test for D-017 / D-018 / D-014 / D-048.** They live inside
  `main.js`, which is a single 9k-line Electron module with no seam a
  `node --test` process can drive; extracting each would be a larger change
  than the fix. Stated rather than papered over. The `ipc-contract`-style
  source-level guard was not used here because these are control-flow facts,
  not textual ones.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* delete the `engine:status` push rather than expose it in preload.
  The renderer states its choice in a comment ("pull beats push here: no
  subscription lifecycle to leak across window reloads") and implements it; a
  channel with a sender and no receiver is not a second surface.
- *Chosen:* one `noteBackendHealthy(source)` used by both reset sites, instead
  of duplicating the counter-clearing logic on the restart path.
- *Chosen:* bound the recovery poll at 40 x 3 s (two minutes) and end with a
  message that says what happened, rather than removing the poll.

**Not done in this commit:** nothing from this group.

## Commit 7 — `0bf8ed7` · status SSOT & the reachable autostop state

**IDs:** D-012 (P1), D-013 (P1), plus hypothesis **H-1** (a click on an amber
capsule would have been a no-op once autostop became reachable — fixed in the
same change, as the report advised).

**Files:** `desktop/recording-status.js` (new), `desktop/recording-status.test.js`
(new), `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/package.json`.

**Re-verified on current code:** yes — both ladders were still present and still
disagreed.

**Verification**
- The two pre-fix ladders, extracted from `889c91a` and run over the real
  vocabulary (this is the evidence for the drift):
  ```
  "Starting"          mode=recording     tone=neutral
  "App Loading"       mode=fail          tone=warning
  "Grant Access"      mode=fail          tone=warning
  "App Not Ready"     mode=transcribing  tone=warning
  "Mic Not Started"   mode=transcribing  tone=neutral
  "Pasting"           mode=transcribing  tone=neutral
  "Timed out, but transcript is on your clipboard."  mode=transcribing tone=neutral
  "Timed out with no transcript to recover."         mode=transcribing tone=neutral
  ```
- `recording-status.test.js` walks all 27 statuses either process produces and
  asserts the kind each one MEANS; a source-level assertion fails if a second
  classifier reappears in `main.js`; another fails if the renderer rewords one
  of the four strings main.js has to classify.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 199 / pass 199 / fail 0` (was 191).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.
- `packaging.test.js` green after adding `recording-status.js` to `build.files`
  (observed failing without it).

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* kind travels WITH the status, and the ladder is kept only as the
  compatibility path for renderer-authored text — the report's own
  recommendation. Every main-process producer now names its kind.
- *Chosen:* a failed paste is `WARN`, not `FAIL`. The transcript is always on the
  clipboard at that point and the status says which key pastes it; drawing it as
  a hard error would misdescribe a one-keypress recovery.
- *Chosen (product):* the autostop countdown is announced as
  `Auto stop in <n>s` and cancelled by speech. The alternative — leaving the
  amber state unreachable and deleting its CSS — would have removed a warning
  the user demonstrably needs, since the mechanism ends recordings on its own.

**Not done**
- The renderer does not yet send its own `statusKind` (it computes one for
  itself already). Doing so would delete the compatibility ladder outright, but
  it is a `frontend/` change and another agent owns that tree. Recorded as a
  follow-up.

## Commit 8 — `19b0235` · engine overlap policy

**IDs:** D-010 (P1), D-011 (P1, was "hypothesis" — confirmed), D-054 (P2, was
"hypothesis" — confirmed).

**Files:** `desktop/engine-deps.js`, `desktop/engine-deps.test.js`,
`desktop/main.js`.

**Verification (pre-fix behaviour replayed from `889c91a`)**
```
compareVersions("1.0rc1", "1.0")                = 1     (PEP 440: < 0)
specifierSatisfied(">=1.0", "1.0rc1")           = true  (should be false)
parseRequiresDist('sympy>=1.14; python_version >= "3.11"') = []   (dropped)
```
Both "hypotheses" in the discovery report are therefore confirmed facts.
- New PEP 440 ordering checked against 13 cases (rc/alpha/beta/dev/post/epoch/
  local/trailing-zero), all correct.
- New marker evaluator checked against the shapes real METADATA uses, including
  `and`/`or`, reversed operands, `in`, and the two undecidable shapes
  (parentheses, unknown variable) which return null.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 208 / pass 208 / fail 0` (was 199).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* delete by the distribution's own `RECORD` (pip's authoritative file
  list), with a conventional-layout fallback when RECORD is unreadable, and a
  path guard on both. *Rejected:* the report's suggestion of removing
  `<name>/`, `<name>.libs/`, `<name>.py` only — that misses top-level modules
  and data files a wheel installs under other names, and would have silently
  left them shadowing.
- *Chosen:* EVALUATE markers rather than treat every marked requirement as
  undecidable. Treating them all as undecidable would have turned nearly every
  overlapping name in torch's METADATA into a conflict and broken the engine
  install outright — a regression dressed as a fix. Only genuinely
  undecidable markers (parentheses, unknown variables) become conflicts.
- *Chosen:* `extra == "..."` evaluates to false, because
  `requirements-gigaam.txt` requests no extras. Recorded here because it is the
  one marker whose answer is a policy choice rather than a fact.
- *Chosen:* the marker environment's `python_version` comes from the engine
  interpreter itself (`resolvePythonVersion`), not from a constant; an unknown
  version makes version markers undecidable rather than guessing.

**Not done in this commit:** nothing from this group.

## Commit 9 — Python version SSOT

**IDs:** D-069 (P2), D-068 (P2, the `.python-version` half).

**Files:** `.python-version` (new, committed), `.gitignore`,
`desktop/scripts/prepare-runtime.sh`, `.github/workflows/tests.yml`,
`desktop/python-version.js` (new), `desktop/python-version.test.js` (new),
`desktop/main.js`, `desktop/package.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes. `grep` over the tree at
`1a12c3c` still found the version typed into `prepare-runtime.sh` six times
(`PBS_PYVER="3.12.13"`, `cp312` ×3, `python3.12/site-packages` ×2,
`--python-version 3.12`), `tests.yml:24`, `main.js` (the winget hint),
`AGENTS.md:19`, `CONTRIBUTING.md:27` and `:137`, `NOTICE.md:13` —
and `.gitignore:13` forbade the one file that could hold it.

**Verification**
- Every new assertion replayed against `git show HEAD:<file>` (pre-fix source):
  ```
  OLD prepare-runtime.sh reads .python-version: false
  OLD prepare-runtime.sh retypes cp3NN: true
  OLD prepare-runtime.sh retypes pythonX.Y/: true
  OLD tests.yml uses python-version-file: false
  OLD tests.yml pins a literal version: true
  OLD main.js requires ./python-version: false
  OLD main.js hardcodes winget Python.Python.3.12: true
  ```
  i.e. all six guards in `python-version.test.js` fail on the old tree.
- The derivation reproduces the literals it replaces, run the way the script
  runs it (`bash -c`, same `tr`/`case`/`%.*`/`//./` expressions):
  ```
  PBS_PYVER=3.12.13 PY_XY=3.12 PY_ABI_TAG=cp312
  ```
  — byte-identical to the removed `3.12.13` / `3.12` / `cp312`.
- `bash -n desktop/scripts/prepare-runtime.sh` -> OK.
- `packaging.test.js` catches the new module if it is left out of
  `build.files` (observed by removing the entry):
  `main.js -> ./python-version.js is MISSING from build.files` -> `fail 1`.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 213 / pass 213 / fail 0` (was 208).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* `.python-version` holds the full `X.Y.Z`, and `X.Y` / `cpXY` are
  DERIVED. The three shapes the build needs (tarball version, site-packages
  path + pip `--python-version`, wheel ABI tag) are three renderings of one
  fact, so only the fact is stored.
- *Chosen:* the file is committed and `.gitignore` says why in place of the
  old blanket `.python-version` line. A `.gitignore` entry that hides the
  SSOT is how the duplication became necessary in the first place.
- *Chosen:* `prepare-runtime.sh` **dies** on a missing or malformed file
  rather than falling back to a literal. A fallback is a second source of
  truth wearing a default's clothes. The same rule shapes
  `parsePythonVersion`, which returns `null` instead of guessing, and
  `main.js`, which then names no version at all instead of a wrong one.
- *Chosen:* `log`/`warn`/`die` moved above their first call site in
  `prepare-runtime.sh`. The version gate is the first thing that can fail, and
  it sits above where `die()` used to be defined; leaving it there would have
  turned a clear error into `die: command not found`.
- *Chosen:* `.python-version` ships in `extraResources` so `getRepoRoot()`
  resolves it in a packaged app the same way it already resolves
  `requirements.txt`. *Rejected:* a constant in `main.js` guarded by a test —
  that is a copy plus a tripwire, not one source.
- *Chosen:* `NOTICE.md` keeps its literal `Python 3.12.13` (a redistribution
  notice must spell the version out) and the test locks every
  `Python X.Y.Z` it names to the SSOT.

**Not done in this commit**
- `desktop/engine-deps.js:52` and two `main.js` comments still say "3.12" while
  narrating a past bug; the one path-shaped comment was generalised, the
  historical ones are prose about what happened and are left as written.

## Commit 10 — dependency pins SSOT

**IDs:** D-026 (P1).

**Files:** `desktop/package.json`, `desktop/main.js`,
`.github/workflows/tests.yml`, `desktop/packaging.test.js`, `AGENTS.md`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes, and on the SHIPPED app.
`ls /Applications/Transcriptor.app/Contents/Resources/` (installed 1.6.0):
```
ENABLE_GIGAAM
requirements-gigaam.txt
requirements.txt
```
— `requirements.runtime-lock.txt` is not there, so the on-device repair
install could not have applied it even if it had tried.

**Verification (pre-fix behaviour replayed from `git show HEAD:`)**
```
OLD backend pip calls: 2
   "-m","pip","install","-r",requirementsPath                                  | has constraints: false
   "-m","pip","install","--user","--break-system-packages","-r",requirementsPath | has constraints: false
OLD CI applies the lock: false
OLD extraResources destinations: backend, frontend, requirements.txt, .python-version, requirements-gigaam.txt, ENABLE_GIGAAM
```
Three installers, one of them applying the lock. After the fix all three do,
and the two new packaging tests assert each of the three by its own text.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 215 / pass 215 / fail 0` (was 213).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* one `constraintArgs` array, built once and spread into both pip
  invocations. The report's suggested edit touched only the first call; a
  retry that installs a different version set than the attempt it replaces is
  a second source of truth reachable only from a failure.
- *Chosen:* a missing lock **warns and continues** here, unlike
  `prepare-runtime.sh`, which dies. The build must not produce an unlocked
  bundle; a user whose Resources are damaged is better served by dependencies
  installed loosely than by an app that refuses to repair itself.
- *Chosen:* the optional-engine install (`requirements-gigaam.txt` into a
  staging site) is deliberately NOT constrained by the runtime lock, and the
  test says so. It is a different dependency set, and `engine-deps.js` already
  reconciles it against the bundle by its own rules; constraining it here
  would be a behaviour change to the engine path that no finding asks for.
- *Chosen:* `requirements.txt` keeps its five deliberate ranges. The lock is
  the release rendering of them, not a replacement — the header of the lock
  file states that policy and it is unchanged.

**Not done in this commit:** nothing from this group.

## Commit 11 — CI runs every suite, on a platform that can run it

**IDs:** D-027 (P1), D-071 (P2).

**Files:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml`, `desktop/packaging.test.js`,
`AGENTS.md`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes.

**Verification (pre-fix workflow, replayed from `git show HEAD:`)**
```
OLD desktop job runs-on: ubuntu-latest
OLD workflow declares permissions: false
OLD workflow declares concurrency: false
OLD desktop job runs node --check: false
```
The two suites that had never executed in CI, confirmed by name on this Mac:
```
darwin-gated cases that ran here: 2
  ✔ every AppleScript in main.js compiles      (applescript.test.js)
  ✔ both shapes compile                        (paste-script.test.js)
```
They are the only `process.platform !== "darwin"` gates in the tree, and the
new test asserts exactly that list — so if the reason for the macOS runner
moves, the test says so instead of the runner silently becoming decoration.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 216 / pass 216 / fail 0` (was 215).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.
- The workflow parses as YAML (`yaml.safe_load` -> `name, on, permissions,
  concurrency, jobs`).

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* move the desktop job to `macos-latest` rather than install an
  AppleScript compiler on Linux (there is none) or drop the skip guard (the
  tests would fail, not run). The suite takes ~2 s; the macOS minute
  multiplier is the price of the only CI that can compile the shipped script.
- *Chosen:* `node --check` as its own step, before `npm test`. AGENTS.md has
  declared it a required check all along and CI had never run it;
  `packaging.test.js` reads `main.js` as *text*, so nothing else in the suite
  ever parses these two files as modules.
- *Chosen:* `permissions: contents: read` at workflow level, not per job —
  no job in this file writes anything, and a per-job list would be three
  copies of one fact.
- *Chosen:* `concurrency.group` is `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`.
  The WIP draft prefixed it with a literal `tests-` as well, which only
  restates `github.workflow`.

**Not done in this commit**
- Both osacompile tests still `return` silently if `osacompile` itself is
  missing. On `macos-latest` it is present; making that a hard failure would
  trade a real guard for a runner-image assumption. Left as written.

## Commit 12 — packaging & release invariants

**IDs:** D-060 (P2), D-063 (P2, recorded as debt), D-064 (P2), D-065 (P2),
D-066 (P2), D-067 (P2), D-068 (P2, the remaining three defects), D-070 (P2),
D-083 (P2).

**Files:** `.gitignore`, `desktop/package.json`, `desktop/packaging.test.js`,
`desktop/scripts/prepare-runtime.sh`, `desktop/scripts/notarize-dmg.sh`,
`desktop/scripts/generate-dmg-background.py`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes, each by running the
mechanism rather than reading it.

**Verification**
- D-067 / D-068, measured with `git check-ignore -v --no-index` on the
  pre-fix file:
  ```
  .gitignore:84:desktop/build/   desktop/build/dmg-background.png   (tracked, and named by build.dmg.background)
  .gitignore:106:.claude/        .claude/launch.json                (tracked)
  .gitignore:79:!desktop/scripts/prepare-runtime.sh                 (a negation of nothing — desktop/runtime/ never covers desktop/scripts/)
  desktop/dist/ listed twice, at :33 and :82
  ```
  After: both tracked files report unignored, `desktop/dist/x`,
  `desktop/build/other.png` and `.claude/settings.local.json` still ignored.
- D-066, from `app-builder-lib/out/fileMatcher.js` — `addPatterns(config[name])`
  then `addPatterns(options.customBuildOptions[name])`, i.e. concatenation:
  ```
  OLD mac   duplicated destinations: ["requirements-gigaam.txt","ENABLE_GIGAAM"]
  OLD win   duplicated destinations: ["requirements-gigaam.txt","ENABLE_GIGAAM"]
  OLD linux duplicated destinations: ["requirements-gigaam.txt","ENABLE_GIGAAM"]
  OLD mas   duplicated destinations: []
  ```
  (`mas` was never *missing* them — the top-level list covers it. Three copies
  were dead weight, not a gap.) After: all four platforms report `[]`.
- D-070: `OLD artifactName: undefined`. The five strings that reproduce
  electron-builder's default expect `Transcriptor-<version>-arm64.dmg`; the
  new template expands to exactly that, asserted against `notarize-dmg.sh`.
- D-083: `OLD npm scripts running bash unguarded: dist, dist:dir, dist:adhoc,
  dist:dir:adhoc, notarize:dmg, dist:mas, testflight:upload, dist:linux` —
  eight of nine. Now the test enumerates `pkg.scripts` and requires the guard
  on every one that shells out to bash.
- D-060, both branches reproduced with a stubbed `notarytool`:
  ```
  OLD: error: Could not authenticate
       script continued; log file contains: []
  NEW: Could not fetch the notarization log for submission 1234:
       error: Could not authenticate
  ```
  The old form left an empty log and a message indistinguishable from
  "notarization was rejected for no stated reason".
- D-064, two `ffmpeg.exe` in one extracted tree:
  ```
  OLD picked: BUILD-B     (last match the traversal reached)
  NEW picked: BUILD-A     (first match, then stop — as mac and linux already do)
  ```
- D-065: the refactor is pixel-neutral. Both script versions were executed
  against the same Pillow and fonts and their outputs compared:
  ```
  OLD script vs NEW script — difference bbox: None
  ```
  The derived geometry reproduces the removed literals exactly
  (178+82+22 = 282, 482-82-22 = 378, head 378-22 = 356, ±14).
- `bash -n` on both shell scripts, `ast.parse` on the Python -> OK.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 220 / pass 220 / fail 0` (was 216).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* `desktop/build/*` with a negation, not `desktop/build/`. Git does
  not descend into an excluded directory, so a negation under one can never
  match — the committed background survived only because git already tracked
  it, and a regenerated or renamed one would not have appeared in
  `git status` at all.
- *Chosen:* the bash guard goes on EVERY npm script that shells out to bash,
  including the three macOS-only ones, and the test enumerates the scripts
  rather than naming them. One rule beats a per-script judgement call, which
  is how `dist:win` ended up the only guarded entry point.
- *Chosen:* pin `artifactName` to the template the five existing strings
  already assume, and assert the expansion against `notarize-dmg.sh`. A
  default is not a contract; making it one costs one line and removes the
  upstream-change failure mode without renaming anything.
- *Chosen:* the DMG generator reads `build.dmg.contents` and derives the well
  and arrow geometry from named offsets. *Rejected:* regenerating the
  committed PNG — this machine's Pillow/font stack produces different text
  antialiasing than the commit did (`committed PNG vs OLD script output —
  difference bbox: (43, 41, 521, 152)`, entirely in the two text rows), so
  regenerating would commit an unrelated visual change under a refactor.
  Recorded as debt.
- *Chosen:* the `ffmpeg.exe` search dies with the temp tree cleaned up. The
  old code leaked the mktemp dir on the not-found path.

**Not done in this commit**
- **D-063** (the macOS ffmpeg URL carries no build identifier, so the
  publisher can overwrite it in place): the pinned SHA256 keeps a substituted
  binary out of a release, but the day the file changes every macOS release
  build fails and the only repair is re-deriving the hash from an
  unverifiable source. A versioned mirror is the fix and it is a hosting
  decision. The trade-off is now written at the pin; recorded in "долг".
- "Install for macOS Sonoma" in the generator names an OS release with no
  source in the manifest (`build.mac.minimumSystemVersion` is not set).
  Changing user-visible artwork copy is a product decision; recorded in "долг".

## Commit 13 — the documented hotkeys, and the SSOT pointer that pointed nowhere

**IDs:** D-028 (P1), D-029 (P1), D-078 (P2).

**Files:** `README.md`, `README.en.md`, `desktop/shortcut-defaults.test.js`,
`AGENTS.md`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes — both READMEs still printed
`F9` / `F10`, and `ls PRODUCT.md` still said no such file.

**Verification**
- The new README lock, run against the pre-fix documentation
  (`git show HEAD:README*.md` in a scratch dir with the real manifest):
  ```
  ✖ the documented Windows/Linux hotkeys are the ones the app registers
  ℹ tests 7 / pass 6 / fail 1
  ```
- D-078, the two weakened assertions, shown with a manifest a reviewer would
  expect to be rejected:
  ```
  defaults {"record":"Ctrl+Alt+F10","paste":"Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V"}
    OLD suite: pass 6  fail 0      <- fully green on a chord ending in F10
    NEW suite: pass 5  fail 2

  defaults {"record":"F10","paste":"F9"}   (the legacy pair, swapped)
    OLD suite: pass 5  fail 1      <- "no bare F9/F10" PASSED
    NEW suite: pass 4  fail 3
  ```
  The old `record !== "F9"` / `paste !== "F10"` pair is slot-specific, so the
  legacy keys survive in the other slot; and "3+ modifier chords" checked
  `parts.length >= 3`, which is two modifiers and a key.
- D-029: every path AGENTS.md names now resolves —
  `docs/PRODUCT.md`, `docs/VISION.md`, `.env.example`,
  `desktop/package.json`, `.python-version`, `.nvmrc`,
  `requirements.runtime-lock.txt`, `desktop/shortcut-defaults.json` — all OK.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 221 / pass 221 / fail 0` (was 220).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* a test that reads the READMEs and asserts the manifest's current
  defaults appear and the retired pair does not — rather than generating the
  tables from `shortcut-defaults.json`. The READMEs are prose in two
  languages with their own spelling of a chord (`Ctrl`, not Electron's
  `Control`); generating them would need a templating step in a repo that has
  none. The rendering rule lives in the test, in one function, and the test
  is what fails when they drift.
- *Chosen:* the "bare function key" check covers BOTH slots and consults
  `legacy` for the values, so it cannot go stale against the manifest.
- *Chosen:* AGENTS.md rule 4 now names `docs/PRODUCT.md` as the vision and
  says what `docs/VISION.md` is, instead of leaving a reader to pick.

**Not done in this commit:** nothing from this group.

## Commit 14 — the last two P1s: a half-built surface, and one migration rule

**IDs:** D-009 (P1), D-015 (P1, the desktop half).

**Files:** `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/shortcut-migration.js` (new),
`desktop/shortcut-migration.test.js` (new), `desktop/package.json`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes.

**Verification — D-009**
```
OLD main.js injected __transcriptorAccessibilityStatus: 2 site(s)
OLD main.js 30s poll: true
NEW main.js injections: 0
NEW main.js 30s poll: false
refreshMacAccessibilityTrustState call sites kept: 4
readers of the global anywhere in frontend/: none
```
The four surviving call sites are the ones that matter: boot,
`probePasteCapability` (which every consult of `pasteCapability` funnels
through — window focus, pre-paste, and after a paste fails the way a dead
grant fails), and `whenReady`. So the trust bit is re-read on exactly the
paths that act on it; what is gone is a 30-second interval and a
cross-process `executeJavaScript` feeding a global nothing has ever read.

**Verification — D-015**
- 10 new cases in `shortcut-migration.test.js`, including the ones the
  inlined `if` blocks had no coverage for at all: the retired pair on each
  platform, half a retired pair (left alone — a user's own choice), the
  current defaults as a fixed point, idempotence, and non-mutation of the
  input.
- A source-level assertion fails if `main.js` starts reading `legacy.<key>`
  again, i.e. if the rule grows a second copy inside the 9k-line file.
- A data/rule assertion fails if a `legacy` entry is added to
  `shortcut-defaults.json` that nothing migrates — the precise shape of the
  original bug.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 231 / pass 231 / fail 0` (was 221).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *D-009, chosen:* the report's option 2 (collapse the unreachable), not
  option 1 (build the badge). Option 1 is a `frontend/` change and another
  agent owns that tree; shipping the main-process half alone is what created
  the finding. *Rejected:* replacing the injection with an `invoke` channel —
  that is a new surface with no consumer, which is precisely what D-030
  deleted for `engine:status`.
- *D-009, chosen:* the boot read stays. It is what makes
  `[accessibility] trusted=` appear in the log before the first paste, and it
  is free.
- *D-015, chosen:* extract the rule into a pure module driven by
  `shortcut-defaults.json` rather than add a fourth `if`. The bug is not a
  missing branch, it is that the rule had two hand-written homes and one of
  them fell behind; a fourth branch would leave that shape intact.
- *D-015, rejected:* having the main process WRITE the migrated pair back to
  `config.json`. That would converge the two sides, but the backend owns
  writes to that file — main only ever reads it — and a second writer racing
  the renderer's debounced autosave is a worse defect than the one being
  fixed.
- *D-015, rejected:* migrating the `override` path (accelerators arriving
  from a Settings capture). A pair that arrives there is what the user just
  pressed; rewriting it would mean Settings could not express a choice the
  migration disagrees with.

**Not done**
- **D-015, the renderer half.** `frontend/src/main.tsx`'s `loadCfg`
  implements migrations 1 and 2 and not 3, so Settings still displays `F9`
  on a Windows/Linux config carrying the retired pair while the registered
  hotkey is `Control+Alt+Shift+R`. The fix is for the renderer to call the
  same rule instead of re-deriving it; `shortcut-defaults.json` already
  reaches the renderer through `frontend/vite.config.ts`
  (`__SHORTCUT_DEFAULTS__`), so the data is shared and only the rule is not.
  `frontend/` is another agent's tree. Recorded in "долг" with the exact
  shape.
- **D-009, the badge.** `paste-capability` can already distinguish "never
  granted" from "grant is dead"; what is missing is a renderer surface for
  it. Recorded in "долг".

## Commit 15 — the paste path's last duplicated truths

**IDs:** D-034 (P2), D-035 (P2), D-036 (P2), D-041 (P2), D-049 (P2, resolved
as "not the stated defect" — see Decisions), D-055 (P2), D-074 (P2),
D-084 (P2). D-045 verified as **already fixed** in `19b0235`.

**Files:** `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/paste-script.js`,
`desktop/paste-script.test.js`, `desktop/paste-result.test.js`,
`desktop/paste-capability.js`, `desktop/paste-capability.test.js`,
`desktop/paste-verification-policy.js`,
`desktop/paste-verification-policy.test.js`, `desktop/accelerator.js`,
`desktop/accelerator.test.js`, `desktop/linux-wm-class.js` (new),
`desktop/linux-wm-class.test.js` (new), `desktop/engine-deps.js`,
`desktop/package.json`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes, each one.

**Verification**
- **D-055**, the strongest of the group. Both versions of the module loaded
  side by side and given the same input:
  ```
  "Control++"    OLD -> "Control"    NEW -> "Control++"
  "Cmd++"        OLD -> "Super"      NEW -> "Cmd++"
  "+"            OLD -> ""           NEW -> "+"
  "Control+ +V"  OLD -> "Control+V"  NEW -> "Control+ +V"
  ```
  The last line is the serious one: a stored accelerator with a stray space
  was silently canonicalised into `Control+V` and REGISTERED as a global
  shortcut — the app would have taken over paste for the whole desktop. The
  module now hands malformed input back unchanged so registration fails
  with the string the user actually stored.
- **D-041**, the discarded tail, stated as the property that failed:
  ```
  "org.gnome.Nautilus.Org.gnome.Nautilus".split(".", 2)  ->  ["org", "gnome"]
  ```
  JavaScript's split limit DROPS the tail (unlike Python's `maxsplit`), so
  every modern GNOME/Flatpak window produced instance `org`, class `gnome`,
  and `pickLinuxTargetName` recorded `"gnome"` as the window to bring back
  to the front before pasting. Seven new cases cover the classic form, both
  reverse-DNS forms, the no-dot form and a round-trip property (the halves
  always rejoin to the raw value).
- **D-035**: `OLD main.js hand-written menuPasteScript template: true`. The
  builder moved into `paste-script.js`, so `osacompile` now compiles it
  (`paste-script.test.js`, on macOS) — nothing ever had, because
  `applescript.test.js` scans template LITERALS and that one was
  interpolated in main.js.
- **D-034**: `OLD: any script emitting ERR:secure-field: false` — confirmed
  across both script sources. Three pieces of code described a capability
  the product does not have: the branch, the
  "In Clipboard · Secure Field" status and the classifier entry. All three
  gone; the tests that used the marker as an example now quote markers the
  scripts actually print.
- **D-036**:
  ```
  OLD call sites: ["pasted.reason", "pasted.reason"]
  NEW call sites: ["pasted.reason", "pasted.reason, systemPasteAccelerator()"]
  ```
  The second site is the paste-last hotkey path, where the old status read
  "In Clipboard — press Alt+Shift+V" after Alt+Shift+V had just failed.
- **D-074**: the source carried a raw 0x00 byte at offset 9221
  (`escapeAppleScriptString("a<NUL>b")`), so git treated the file as binary
  and `git log -p` was useless on it. `file desktop/paste-script.test.js`
  now reports `Unicode text, UTF-8 text`.
- **D-084**: the stray `//` inside a `/** */` block in `engine-deps.js` is a
  `*` line; AX trace reads keep the order they BEGAN in, with unfinished
  ones in their own slot rather than appended at the end. Two new cases.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 243 / pass 243 / fail 0` (was 231).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *D-055, chosen:* return malformed input UNCHANGED rather than repair it.
  A repair here would be this module guessing what the user meant; refusing
  makes `safeRegisterShortcut` report the failure with the string that is
  actually stored, which is the only string the user can go and fix.
- *D-034, chosen:* delete rather than implement. Detecting a secure text
  field needs an `AXSubrole` read of the focused element — the expensive
  call this ladder is built to avoid, on the one path where the user is
  waiting. Same precedent as D-030 (a channel with a sender and no
  receiver). Recorded in "долг" as a product item.
- *D-036, chosen:* a `systemPasteAccelerator()` (`Cmd+V` / `Ctrl+V`) for the
  paste-last path, not "drop the hint". The transcript IS on the clipboard;
  the advice was circular, not useless.
- *D-041, chosen:* an explicit rule — halves equal apart from case split in
  the middle, otherwise split at the LAST dot — rather than "keep the tail
  on the second element". Keeping the tail would have turned instance `org`
  into instance `org` and class `gnome.Nautilus.Org.gnome.Nautilus`: still
  wrong, just differently. The raw string is kept as `wmClass` and
  `scoreLinuxWindowMatch` weights it, so a shape this rule reads differently
  than the window manager intended still has an exact-match path.
- *D-035, chosen:* move the script into `paste-script.js` rather than delete
  the second attempt. It is a genuinely different last rung — it forces
  `frontmost` and does no verification — and it is the only thing between a
  failed primary and a bare clipboard.

**Not done / resolved otherwise**
- **D-049 — not the stated defect.** `const at = Date.now() - spawnedAt`
  being computed per chunk rather than per line changes nothing: every line
  in one chunk genuinely arrived at the same instant, and moving the call
  into the loop would only measure this process's own parsing. The real
  limit is that the resolution is bounded by pipe-chunk arrival, so a read
  faster than one chunk reports 0. That is a floor on what can be measured
  from outside the process, and 0 is the honest answer for "shorter than one
  chunk" — now written at the site that computes it, so the number is not
  over-trusted. The chronology half of the complaint (D-084) IS a defect and
  is fixed.
- **D-045 — устранено ранее в `19b0235`.** `reconcileEngineSiteWithBundle`
  was rewritten to delete by the distribution's own RECORD; the
  `` `${siteDir}/…` `` concatenation went with it. `grep` finds one
  remaining `siteDir}` and it is inside a log message, not a path.

## Commit 16 — the identity strings the manifest owns

**IDs:** D-081 (P2), plus the four "хардкод → SSOT" rows the discovery report
listed without an ID: appId, productName, port 8321, copyright.

**Files:** `desktop/package.json`, `desktop/shortcut-defaults.json`,
`desktop/shortcut-defaults.test.js`, `desktop/packaging.test.js`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes.
```
appId  local.transcriptor.app  — package.json:40, INSTALL_ON_OTHER_MAC.command:20, README.md:136, README.en.md:143
port   8321                    — main.js DEFAULT_BACKEND_PORT, .env.example:12, README.md:137, README.en.md:146
copyright                      — package.json:39 and twice more in mac/mas extendInfo
```

**Verification**
- The copyright duplication is provably a no-op override, read from the
  installed builder: `app-builder-lib/out/macPackager.js:400` does
  `appPlist.NSHumanReadableCopyright = appInfo.copyright` and only then
  `deepAssign(appPlist, extendInfo)`. So the two `extendInfo` copies wrote
  the same string over itself. One declaration left; the test fails if a
  second appears.
- D-081, measured:
  ```
  OLD bytes shipped to the renderer: 1152
  NEW bytes shipped to the renderer:  293
  data identical apart from _comment: true
  ```
  The 845-character rationale moved verbatim into
  `shortcut-defaults.test.js`, next to the assertions it justifies, and a
  new test walks the manifest and fails on any `_`-prefixed key or any
  string too long to be an accelerator.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 245 / pass 245 / fail 0` (was 243).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *Chosen:* a test that locks the copies to the manifest, rather than
  generating them. A bash installer, two prose READMEs and an env template
  legitimately have to spell these values out; what was missing is anything
  that notices when one stops matching. The manifest stays the SSOT and the
  copies become followers.
- *Chosen:* `.env.example` is read as the SSOT for the port (AGENTS.md rule
  4) and `main.js`'s `DEFAULT_BACKEND_PORT` is checked against it, not the
  other way round — main.js's own comment calls itself the SSOT, and rule 4
  says otherwise.
- *Chosen:* delete the copyright duplicates outright rather than have the
  hook derive them. electron-builder already derives them; a hook doing it
  again would be a third mechanism.

## Commit 17 — two tests that could not fail

**IDs:** D-077 (P2), D-079 (P2).

**Files:** `desktop/paste-capability.test.js`, `desktop/packaging.test.js`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes. `grep -n
"pasteBudgetWorstCaseMs" desktop/*.js` still showed the function called from
the test file only, and `positiveWhitelist()` still dropped every `!`
pattern before matching.

**Verification**
- D-077. The new scan brace-matches ten paste-path functions in `main.js`
  and fails on any wall-clock literal inside them. Replayed against the
  pre-D-019 source (`889c91a`), i.e. the state the report described:
  ```
  889c91a runPasteLadder               unbudgeted timeouts: []
  889c91a activateAppByPid             unbudgeted timeouts: ["5000","5000"]
  889c91a activateAppByName            unbudgeted timeouts: ["5000","5000"]
  889c91a activateMacCapturedWindow    unbudgeted timeouts: ["5000"]
  889c91a sendCommandEnterToFocusedApp unbudgeted timeouts: ["3200","2000","2000","2000","2000","2000","5000","5000"]
  ```
  Thirteen unbudgeted timeouts — exactly D-019 and D-047 — which the old
  "worst case fits the deadline" test passed straight over, because it
  compared the table against itself. The scan also asserts each function
  still exists, so it cannot silently start covering nothing.
- D-079. The matcher now applies `build.files` IN ORDER with last-match-wins,
  the rule electron-builder itself uses, and understands the glob subset the
  manifest actually contains. Cases asserted:
  ```
  ["main.js","accelerator.js"]                    accelerator.js -> included
  ["main.js","accelerator.js","!accelerator.js"]  accelerator.js -> EXCLUDED   (old matcher: included)
  ["**/*","!lib/**"]                              lib/drop.js    -> excluded
  ["**/*","!lib/**","lib/keep.js"]                lib/keep.js    -> included
  "*.js" vs "lib/main.js"                         -> false  (* does not cross a separator)
  "runtime/**/*" vs "runtimex/a.js"               -> false
  ```
  Plus a sweep asserting every literal entry in the real manifest matches
  itself and that `!runtime/**/*` still excludes what it names.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 247 / pass 247 / fail 0` (was 245).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *D-077, chosen:* keep `pasteBudgetWorstCaseMs` and make it FAITHFUL rather
  than delete it or inline its formula into main.js. The number is only
  meaningful next to `PASTE_POST_STOP_DEADLINE_MS`, and what was missing was
  never the arithmetic — it was any evidence that the ladder spends its clock
  through the table. A source scan is the only seam a `node --test` process
  has into a 9k-line Electron module, and it is the one that would have
  caught the original defect.
- *D-079, chosen:* a deliberately small glob (`**` crosses separators, `*`
  and `?` do not). Anything richer would be a second minimatch to get wrong,
  and the manifest uses exactly this subset.

## Commit 18 — symbols that were not capabilities, and a log that was not bounded

**IDs:** D-031 (P2, deferred from commit 4), D-051 (P2), D-052 (P2),
D-053 (P2, desktop half), D-059 (P2), D-082 (P2).

**Files:** `desktop/main.js`, `desktop/renderer-console.js`,
`desktop/renderer-console.test.js`, `desktop/paste-capability.js`,
`desktop/paste-capability.test.js`,
`desktop/paste-verification-policy.test.js`, `desktop/ipc-contract.test.js`,
`desktop/unlockDist.js`.

**Re-verified on current code before fixing:** yes.
`grep -c bundleId desktop/main.js` -> `0`; `grep -n "Electron 30"` -> three
comments against a manifest pinning `electron 42.4.1`; `PASTE_TRANSIENT_TYPE`
imported by nothing but its own test.

**Verification — measured on this Mac, not reasoned**
- **D-031**. The amended frontmost read, run live:
  ```
  Telegram Lite|87282|n8n Чат & Сообщество @ Leo Erdman (594978)|org.telegram.desktop
  ```
  The bundle id is read in the SAME Apple Event as the name and the pid, so
  it is not a second round trip. Measured, 8 runs each:
  ```
  without bundle id, ms: 205 250 258 275 276 283 286 367 | median 276
  with    bundle id, ms: 239 239 269 269 282 290 303 337 | median 282
  median delta: 6 ms (declared bound 5000 ms)
  ```
  `applescript.test.js` compiles the amended script (3 pass, on macOS).
- **D-082**, the bound, asserted as behaviour: 50 error lines in one window
  with a budget of 3 produce exactly 3 lines; the next window opens with
  `console mirror dropped 47 message(s) in the previous 1000 ms` and then
  resumes. A renderer under the limit is mirrored unchanged across 100
  simulated seconds. A varying message (`?attempt=0`, `?attempt=1`, …) is
  still bounded — which is why the bound is a window and not a dedup.
- **D-059**, both versions run against a `dist/` subtree that cannot be
  listed:
  ```
  OLD exit=0 | stdout: ""  | stderr: ""
  NEW exit=1 | stdout: ""  | stderr: "[unlockDist] Could not unlock 1 path(s); electron-builder will fail on them:   …/dist/opaque: EACCES"
  ```
  The old `catch { return; }` made "this path is gone" and "this path cannot
  be read" the same event, and the build died later inside electron-builder
  with an EACCES that pointed at a file rather than at the pass that skipped
  it.
- `npm --prefix desktop test` -> `tests 253 / pass 253 / fail 0` (was 247).
- `node --check desktop/main.js && node --check desktop/preload.js` -> OK.

**Decisions**
- *D-031, chosen:* read the bundle id in the existing Apple Event rather than
  add one. Commit 4 deferred this expecting an extra event; there is a
  process property to hand, and it measures at 6 ms.
- *D-052, chosen:* delete the two constants, KEEP the twenty lines of
  analysis. The reasoning (why `clipboard.write` and `clipboard.writeBuffer`
  both cannot add a UTI to an existing pasteboard item) is what stops the
  next reader spending a day rediscovering it; the constants were a symbol
  pretending to be a capability, and the test asserted a literal against
  itself.
- *D-082, chosen:* a rolling window, not a per-message dedup — a retry loop
  varies its text, so a dedup would pass it straight through. One limiter
  per window, so a reload gets a fresh budget and two windows cannot spend
  each other's. The suppression summary is NOT charged against the budget:
  it is at most one line per window by construction, so it cannot become a
  log source of its own, and charging for it would starve the line the
  budget exists to let through.
- *D-059, chosen:* `process.exitCode = 1` rather than throwing. The npm
  script chain is `&&`-joined, so a non-zero exit stops the build at the
  step that knows why — but the paths that WERE unlocked stay unlocked, so
  a rerun after fixing permissions has less to do.
- *D-051, chosen:* justify the APIs by the floor that is actually enforced
  (`engines.node >= 22.12`, and the pinned Electron in devDependencies)
  rather than by a version number in prose that goes stale on every bump.

**Not done**
- **D-053, the renderer half.** `preload.js`'s `onSystemSuspend` returns an
  unsubscribe and `frontend/src/main.tsx` discards it. The test's stated
  reason was also wrong — a renderer reload destroys the preload world and
  its listeners, so the reload was never the leak; the reachable one is a
  second subscription in one page lifetime. The reason is corrected and the
  renderer change is in "долг".
