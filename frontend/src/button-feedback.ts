/**
 * "It worked" on the button the user just pressed.
 *
 * There were two of these. History's and the Result pane's Copy buttons
 * flashed classes plus `aria-label`/`title` for 900 ms; Upload's
 * per-item Copy swapped its visible text for 1200 ms with its own
 * `setTimeout`. One gesture, two mechanics, two durations — and the
 * text-swapping one had no way to say "Copy failed" to a screen reader
 * while the class-swapping one had no visible label at all.
 *
 * Both bugs of the surviving implementation are fixed here rather than
 * carried over:
 *
 *  - it read the labels to restore out of the LIVE element, where a
 *    previous flash had already written "Copied", so a second click
 *    inside the window restored "Copied" as if it were the resting
 *    state — permanently, to anyone using a screen reader;
 *  - it never kept the timer handle, so the first flash's restore still
 *    fired after the second flash had begun.
 *
 * The duration is `UI_TOKENS.feedback.flashMs`, passed in: this module
 * is about the mechanism, and the number belongs with the app's other
 * numbers.
