 * the *formatted* string, and the browser formats a caught error as
 * `[object DOMException]` or `[object Object]`. The context survives;
 * the reason does not.
 *
 * A concrete cost: every recording this app made fell back from
 * AudioWorklet to the deprecated ScriptProcessor capture path, and the
 * only evidence was
 *
 *     [renderer WARN] AudioWorklet capture init failed;
 *                     falling back to ScriptProcessor [object DOMException]
 *
 * The fallback was visible; the cause (a CSP refusing a `data:` script)
 * was not, and finding it took reading the build output rather than the
 * log that was supposed to say so.
 *
 * Fixing this at ~25 call sites would fix the 25 that exist today.
 * `installErrorAwareConsole` fixes the formatting once, for every site
 * present and future, which is the only version of this that stays
 * fixed.
