/**
 * How a recording is named from its own transcript (SSOT).
 *
 * There were two implementations of this rule and they disagreed. The
 * stop path normalised whitespace, capped the result and fell back to
 * the date when there was no text; the Re-transcribe path in History did
 * none of the three. So a recording whose first eight words run past 80
 * characters — compound German, a pasted URL, dictated base64 — came out
 * of Re-transcribe with a title longer than `stopLive` has ever produced,
 * and Re-transcribe on an empty result named it "". Which name an
 * archive entry ended up with depended on which path produced its text,
 * which is not something a user can see or predict.
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no clock. Unit-tested in tests/recording-title.test.ts.
