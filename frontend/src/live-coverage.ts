/**
 * Live-transcript adoption policy for the LOCAL provider.
 *
 * At stop, a local-provider recording can either re-transcribe the saved
 * file from scratch or reuse what the live assist already decoded while
 * the user was speaking. Re-transcribing costs time proportional to the
 * recording length — the "sometimes the transcript takes twenty seconds"
 * stall — but reusing is only safe when the live pass provably saw every
 * captured second and ran the same model the final pass would run.
 *
 * The decision is isolated here, as a pure function over primitives, for
 * two reasons: it is the single place the rule is defined, and it can be
 * unit tested (see ``backend/tests/test_live_coverage_policy.py``)
 * without standing up a recording session.
 *
 * Coverage has two halves and both must be clean:
 *
 *  * The **backend** half — ``complete`` — certifies that everything the
 *    server received reached the model. It is computed once, in
 *    ``LiveSession.finalize_envelope``, against the same epsilon the
 *    windowing logic uses. It is never re-derived here: a second
 *    tolerance would silently diverge from the first.
 *  * The **client** half — ``framesNeverSent`` — accounts for audio the
 *    renderer captured but never managed to hand over. The server cannot
 *    see that, so a transcript can be "complete" server-side and still be
 *    missing the words the user spoke during a slow WebSocket handshake.
 *
 * Every rejection carries a reason so the decision is visible in the
 * trace log instead of being an unexplained branch.
 *
 * The Deepgram streaming path used to share this module's dead-stream
 * and envelope-coverage arithmetic (``decideDeadStreamRecovery``,
 * ``envelopeCoversRecording``, ``TAIL_GAP_THRESHOLD_SEC``). It no longer
 * asks any of those questions: the backend's ``final`` envelope is
 * complete by construction and is the only source of the delivered
 * transcript, so the one thing the renderer still decides there is
 * whether an envelope arrived at all (``envelopeMissing`` in
 * ./envelope-deadline). Those predicates were deleted rather than left
 * unused — a second, unread coverage rule is exactly the parallel owner
 * this change exists to remove.
 */

/**
 * True when this session dropped captured audio on the client side —
 * discarded at the pending-buffer cap, lost to a failed ``send``, or
 * still queued when the socket went away. This is the client half of
 * the coverage contract (see module doc); the server cannot see this
 * loss, so it must gate adoption independently of whatever the server
 * reports.
 *
 * PROTOCOL CONTRACT R4 (BUGS_AUDIT_2026-09-03 §4.6). On the Deepgram
 * path the same loss is now the backend's to see and to close: the
 * renderer reports its frame and byte totals on ``finalize``, the
 * backend drains exactly the frames it is owed and re-decodes whatever
 * span it still cannot account for from its own audio spool. Here it
 * remains a gate, because adopting the local assist's own output means
 * skipping the full pass entirely — and audio that never left the
 * renderer reached no model at all.
