/**
 * The ``final`` WebSocket envelope — the renderer's HALF of one contract.
 *
 * The backend's half is ``backend/live_envelope.py``, and it is the only
 * place a ``final`` message is built. This module is the only place one
 * is read. Before B-038 there was no "only place" on either side: the
 * backend wrote the message out by hand at five call sites in three
 * mutually incompatible shapes (the Deepgram drain, the local assist
 * with its FLAT coverage keys, and two error paths carrying a third
 * subset), and ``parseLiveWsMessage`` had to be the union of all three.
 * Adding a field to one side was then a silent no-op on the other —
 * which, for a message that IS the delivered transcript, means words
 * quietly not arriving.
 *
 * What keeps the two halves honest is not this comment. It is
 * ``contracts/live-final-envelope.json``: produced by the backend's own
 * builder in ``backend/tests/test_live_envelope.py`` and parsed by
 * ``frontend/tests/live-envelope.test.ts``. Rename or re-nest a field on
 * either side and the other side's suite goes red.
 *
 * Reading rules, unchanged from the parser this replaces and stated
 * once here instead of per field:
 *
 *  * a number is adopted only when it is finite and non-negative;
 *    anything else reads as ABSENT, never as zero. "No field" and
 *    "proven zero" are different facts, and confusing them is how a
 *    false "fully covered" signal gets believed
 *    (BUGS_AUDIT_2026-09-03 §3.4);
 *  * ``coverage`` is adopted only when the backend actually sent the
 *    ``complete`` boolean. A malformed or null block is absent, and an
 *    absent one refuses adoption in ``./live-coverage`` — never the
 *    other way round;
 *  * segments are normalised by the caller's own normaliser, injected,
 *    because the renderer's segment shape is the renderer's business
 *    and this module has no DOM and no globals.
