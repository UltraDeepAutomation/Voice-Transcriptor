/**
 * Windowing policy for the History list (SSOT).
 *
 * The archive is unbounded — a heavy user reaches several thousand
 * recordings — and every filtered item used to get its own DOM row.
 * At ~5900 recordings that is ~35 000 nodes the renderer builds, styles
 * and keeps resident for a list of which the user can see about twenty.
 *
 * Windowing bounds the DOM without changing what the list *means*:
 * search, keyboard navigation and selection all continue to operate over
 * the complete filtered set. Only how much of it is materialised is
 * capped, and the cap grows as the user scrolls toward the end.
 *
 * Two rules make the window safe to reason about:
 *
 *   * It never hides the selected row. `moveRecordingSelection` finds
 *     the row by key and focuses it — and focus() is what scrolls it
 *     into view — so a selection outside the window would silently do
 *     nothing. The window always extends far enough to contain it.
 *   * It only ever grows within a render cycle. Shrinking is an explicit
 *     `reset` — on a new search or a fresh load — so scrolling back up
 *     never destroys rows the user just scrolled past.
 *
 * Pure module: no DOM, no globals, fully unit-testable.
