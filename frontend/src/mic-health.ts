/**
 * Microphone health — the single source of truth for the question
 * "is the capture pipeline actually delivering audio?".
 *
 * Motivation: on macOS a TCC (privacy) reset — which happens on every
 * reinstall because the ad-hoc code signature changes — does **not**
 * make ``getUserMedia`` reject. It resolves with a live
 * ``MediaStreamTrack`` that emits digital silence forever. The old
 * pipeline had no way to tell that apart from "the user did not speak",
 * so a whole dictation session was saved as a zero-byte-signal WAV and
 * reported as "No speech captured".
 *
 * The discriminator is therefore **not** loudness. A working microphone
 * in a soundproof room still dithers above one 16-bit LSB within a
 * 50 ms window; a dead pipeline emits exactly 0.0. Anything above the
 * dead floor proves the pipeline works and is treated as healthy, no
 * matter how quiet — false "your mic is broken" banners during a normal
 * pause between sentences are far more damaging than missing a genuinely
 * broken mic for a couple of extra seconds.
 *
 * The FSM below is pure and clock-injected so it can be unit tested
 * deterministically (see ``frontend/tests/mic-health.test.ts``; the older
 * ``backend/tests/test_mic_health.py`` compiles this file with tsc from a
 * pytest scenario runner and predates the frontend having a test runner at
 * all — it is a second, weaker copy of the same coverage). All
 * user-visible copy lives in ``STATUS_FOR_STATE`` and is derived from
 * the resulting state, never passed alongside it — that keeps status
 * text single-sourced.
