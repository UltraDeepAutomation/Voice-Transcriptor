/**
 * Warm capture — the decisions that let a recording begin with audio
 * already in hand.
 *
 * Why it exists (BUGS_AUDIT_2026-09-03 §4.7). Measured on 2026-09-03,
 * the cold start path costs `getUserMedia: 82 ms → audioContext: 33 ms
 * → first-frame: 172 ms`: for ~310 ms after the hotkey nothing is
 * recording, and the first syllable of a phrase begun on the press is
 * absent from the WAV *and* from the live stream. When the input device
 * is busy the same path is measured in seconds. Nothing downstream can
 * recover audio that was never captured.
 *
 * Two mechanisms remove it, and both are decided here:
 *
 *   1. WARM HOLD — after Stop the MediaStream, AudioContext and capture
 *      worklet are kept alive for a bounded idle window instead of being
 *      torn down, so the next start pays none of those three costs.
 *   2. PRE-ROLL — while held, the worklet keeps the last few hundred
 *      milliseconds of PCM in a ring buffer and hands it over on the
 *      next start, so the recording begins *before* the hotkey press.
 *
 * The same shape is what the reference implementations converged on:
 * Hex keeps a 1 s ring and pre-rolls 450 ms while warm; whisper-local
 * never closes its input stream at all and trims a 500 ms deque while
 * idle, having found that "opening/closing streams per recording was the
 * source of first-word-clipped bugs"; OpenWhispr holds a master stream
 * and clones a track per recording, expiring pre-roll chunks at 2 s.
 *
 * This module is pure: no DOM, no Web Audio, no timers. `main.tsx` owns
 * the resources and asks these functions what to do with them, so every
 * rule below is unit-tested in tests/capture-warm.test.ts rather than
 * only reachable through a live microphone.

/**
 * Input-device labels that mean "this is a Bluetooth microphone".
 *
 * Holding the microphone open on a Bluetooth headset is not free the way
 * it is on a built-in or USB input: as long as *any* application holds
 * the input, the device stays in the Hands-Free Profile, whose uplink is
 * a narrowband mono codec and whose downlink drops the headset out of
 * A2DP — music and call audio audibly degrade, and stay degraded for the
 * whole hold window. MacParakeet and Handy both disable their warm hold
 * on Bluetooth inputs for exactly this reason.
 *
 * The label is the only signal available. Chromium exposes no transport
 * or bus type on `MediaTrackSettings` or `MediaTrackCapabilities` — the
 * settings dictionary carries `deviceId`, `groupId`, channel/rate and the
 * processing flags, and nothing that distinguishes USB from Bluetooth —
 * so a device-name match is not a shortcut here, it is the whole of what
 * the platform will tell us.
 *
 * The list deliberately over-matches. A false positive costs one
 * optimisation (the next recording starts cold, exactly as it does
 * today); a false negative degrades the user's headset audio for 30 s
 * after every dictation. Those are not comparable, so the tie goes to
 * releasing the device.
