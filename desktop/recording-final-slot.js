// SSOT for the renderer → main transcript hand-off (BUGS_AUDIT_2026-09-03
// §6.7/§6.8): the shape of a "recording-final" IPC payload, and the
// per-recordingId mailbox the post-stop task waits on.
//
// Before this module, ``processPostStopTask`` learned that a transcript
// was ready by running ``executeJavaScript`` in the renderer every 30 ms
// for up to 32 s — up to ~1000 synchronous evaluations injected into the
// renderer at exactly the moment it is finalizing Deepgram, running the
// paste upscale and serializing audio (§6.7). The renderer already knows
// the instant the paste-ready text exists; it now says so once, over IPC.
//
// Two ideas, and nothing else, live here:
//
//   1. ``validateRecordingFinalPayload`` — the ONE definition of what a
//      well-formed hand-off looks like. IPC is renderer-controlled input:
//      a payload that does not match exactly is ignored, never coerced.
//      Coercion is what turned a status string into a "recordingId" and
//      a wall-clock guess into "finality" in the first place.
//
//   2. ``createRecordingFinalSlot`` — a mailbox keyed by recordingId that
//      holds the last signal of each kind and wakes waiters. It exists
//      because the signal and the waiter race: the renderer can publish
//      the final text BEFORE the post-stop task starts waiting (fast
//      recording, slow queue) or long after (slow recovery). A plain
//      event listener drops the first case on the floor; a slot does not.
//
// Deliberately free of Electron and of any timer other than the caller's
// own timeout, so it is exercised directly by
// desktop/recording-final-slot.test.js.

/** Longest ``source`` string kept for logging. Telemetry, not payload. */

/** Recordings tracked at once before the oldest slot is superseded. */

/**
 * The hand-off contract, in one place.
 *
 * Required, exactly:
 *   - ``recordingId``: a safe integer > 0. The renderer's monotonic
 *     ``liveRecordingSeq``. Strings ("7"), floats, 0 and negatives are
 *     rejected rather than coerced — a mismatched id must never let one
 *     recording's text be pasted for another (§6, "сопоставление
 *     recordingId строгое").
 *   - ``text``: a string. May be empty ("nothing to hand off yet").
 *   - ``final``: a boolean. ``true`` means "this is the paste-ready
 *     text"; ``false`` means "this is the best text known so far".
 *     Only a real boolean counts: the truthiness of a wall-clock timer
 *     standing in for finality is the §6.8 defect.
 *
 * Optional:
 *   - ``source``: a free-form label for the trace log. A missing or
 *     non-string source is normalized to "" rather than rejecting the
 *     payload — it carries no meaning for the decision, and dropping a
 *     transcript over a telemetry field would be the wrong trade.
 *
 * Any other key is dropped. Returns the normalized payload, or ``null``
 * if the shape does not match.
