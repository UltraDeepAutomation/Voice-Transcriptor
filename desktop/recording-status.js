// SSOT for "what state is the recording capsule in".
//
// The capsule's only input is a human-readable status string, and the
// machine state was recovered from it by TWO independent substring
// ladders — `recordingStatusMode` for the icon/wave/timer and
// `recordingStatusTone` for the colour. Copies of one decision drift,
// and these had:
//
//   "Starting"          -> mode recording, tone NEUTRAL
//   "App Loading"       -> mode fail,      tone warning
//   "Grant Access"      -> mode fail,      tone warning
//   "App Not Ready"     -> mode transcribing (the default), tone warning
//   "Mic Not Started"   -> mode transcribing, tone neutral
//                          (a terminal error shown as work in progress)
//   "Pasting"           -> mode transcribing, tone neutral
//   "Timed out, but the transcript is on your clipboard…"
//                       -> mode transcribing, tone neutral
//                          (the final recovery status, shown as unfinished)
//
// Nothing about the product requires a status to be a failure by mode
// and a warning by tone. So: a status now travels WITH its kind, and
// mode and tone are two views of that one value — they cannot disagree.
//
// The text ladder does not disappear, because one producer still sends
// text only: the RENDERER. Its user-facing copy ("Recording audio only.
// No transcription provider is selected.", "Recording exceeds 2 hours —
// …") was being parsed here by substring, which made UI copywriting in
// frontend/src/main.tsx a de-facto API for the capsule's colour. That
// ladder is now ONE function, in one place, with the renderer vocabulary
// enumerated next to it and asserted by a test — so at least the
// coupling is visible and checked. When the renderer starts sending its
// own `statusKind` (it already computes one for itself), the ladder goes.
