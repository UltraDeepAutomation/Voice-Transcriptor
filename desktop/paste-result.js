// Pure "did this paste attempt actually succeed, and can we trust the
// clipboard to hold the pasted text after it?" decision — extracted so
// every paste method in desktop/main.js's tryPasteToFocusedField makes
// the call through ONE tested function instead of five near-duplicate
// ad-hoc `if (check.ok) ...` blocks that had drifted out of sync.
//
// BUGS_AUDIT_2026-09-03 §6.1: the Windows VBS branch trusted cscript's
// exit code alone and never looked at stdout, so a VBS script that ran
// to completion without the paste actually landing (AppActivate failing
// silently, SendKeys throwing) was reported as a successful paste — the
// macOS branch, for comparison, already required stdout to start with
// "OK:". This module makes both platforms go through the same kind of
// check, and adds a "verified" bit (§6.4/§6.6) so callers can decide
// whether it is safe to restore the user's previous clipboard.
//
// Every script this module understands prints its own outcome on
// stdout as the LAST line of output:
//   - Windows VBS (SendKeys "^v"):        "SENT:vbs-paste" then "OK:vbs-paste" / "ERR:activate" / (silent + non-zero exit)
//   - Windows PowerShell SendKeys fallback: "OK:pwsh-paste" (SendKeys itself has no failure signal)
//   - Linux (wtype/xdotool/ydotool):       nothing — exit code is the only signal these CLIs give
//   - macOS AppleScript (robust_paste / menu-paste-primary / menu-paste):
//       "OK:<method>[+activated][:verified|:unverified]" / "ERR:<reason>"
//
// The marker strings themselves are NOT retyped here: they come from
// ./paste-protocol, the one place the scripts that print them and the
// parsers that read them agree on.
//
// `ok` — the child process's own exit-code success, from runCommand —
// is required in every branch: a script that never got to run (spawn
// error, PowerShell parse error, timeout + SIGKILL) has no stdout worth
// trusting, no matter what happens to be sitting in the buffer.
