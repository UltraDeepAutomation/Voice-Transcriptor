// Renderer console → support log policy — the single source of truth for
// WHAT of the renderer's console output reaches main.log and in what
// shape. Pure, unit-tested by renderer-console.test.js against the exact
// code Electron loads, mirroring the ./accelerator.js pattern.
//
// ── Why this module exists ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Nothing the renderer logged had ever reached main.log. Measured across
// the full archive set: zero `[renderer …]` lines, in any file, ever.
// Two independent reasons, either of which was sufficient:
//
//   1. The mirror was gated on a development-only flag
//      (TRANSCRIPTOR_RENDERER_TRACE_LOGS=1 / NODE_ENV=development), so
//      in every shipped build it was off.
//   2. The handler read Electron's PRE-36 `console-message` signature,
//      `(event, level, message)`. Electron 36 replaced it with
//      `(event, details)`. On the bundled Electron 42 the third argument
//      is undefined, so even with the flag on, the prefix test compared
//      the string "undefined" and matched nothing.
//
// The cost was not theoretical. The renderer reports its failures with
// console.warn / console.error — a recovery that could not be promoted,
// an AudioWorklet that fell back to ScriptProcessor (a real capture
// quality downgrade), a saved-audio fetch that failed, a key save that
// was rejected. A user-visible error banner therefore left NO trace in
// the support log at all; diagnosing one meant reproducing it by hand.
//
// ── The policy ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Severity decides, not a string prefix:
//
//   error / warning  → always mirrored. These are, by definition, the
//                      renderer telling us something went wrong, and
//                      they are low volume.
//   [trace…] lines   → mirrored only behind the debug flag. These are
//                      high-volume instrumentation, thousands of lines
//                      per session; they are why the flag exists.
//   everything else  → dropped. Routine info/debug chatter is noise in
//                      a support log.
//
// Both call signatures are normalised, so the mirror keeps working
// across an Electron upgrade instead of silently going dark again.

 *
 * `[trace stopLive]` is computed on every stop — the per-phase

 * → stopMediaRecorderAndFlush → pcmSink.finalize → …` with milliseconds
