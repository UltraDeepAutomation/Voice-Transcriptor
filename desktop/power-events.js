// one means".
//
// Two shipped fixes died here once already. `powerMonitor.on("resume")`
// (BUG-81 hotkey re-claim) and the `suspend` / `lock-screen` warm-capture
// release were written for the top level of `app.whenReady`, but landed
// physically nested inside `restoreShortcutsAfterCaptureAbort` — a
// function that returns early unless the user opened Settings, started a
// hotkey capture and then aborted it. In a normal session nothing was
// ever subscribed, and every abort added one more duplicate subscription
// on top.
//
// The registration therefore does not live in main.js as loose statements
// any more. It lives behind one call with three properties a test can
// check without an Electron process:
//
//   * the event → action mapping is data, not control flow;
//   * subscribing twice against the same powerMonitor is a no-op, so a
//     caller that runs more than once cannot accumulate handlers;
//   * a handler that throws is contained — a failed shortcut re-claim
//     must not stop the warm-capture release, and neither may take the
//     app down from inside an OS event callback.

  // The renderer keeps a microphone capture warm between recordings and
  // cannot see powerMonitor — it lives in main. A warm capture carried
  // across a suspend comes back attached to a device that may no longer
  // exist: silence, with no error and no waveform. Sent on both events,
  // because a lock does not always become a suspend and a suspend does
  // not always announce a lock first.
