// The AppleScript the macOS paste path runs, as a pure function of the
// target and of ONE decision: do we verify this paste, or not?
//
// ── Why this is a module and not a template literal in main.js ────────
//
// It used to be an inline template inside tryPasteToFocusedField, which
// meant the only guard on it was desktop/applescript.test.js scanning
// main.js for template literals and compiling them with `${...}`
// replaced by the literal 0. That guard cannot see the script this
// module actually emits, and the script now has TWO shapes — with and
// without the accessibility verification reads. A pure builder can be
// required from a test, so desktop/paste-script.test.js compiles both
// real shapes with osacompile and asserts, textually, that the
// non-verifying shape contains no accessibility read at all.
//
// ── The verification reads and their bound (BUGS_AUDIT §6.6, A3) ──────
//
// Verification means: read the length of the focused element text
// before the paste, read it again after, and call the paste "verified"
// when it grew by exactly the pasted length. Some targets never expose
// an inspectable value — measured against the Claude desktop app on
// macOS 27, AXValue and AXNumberOfCharacters of its focused element
// both fail immediately with -1728 — so for those apps every paste is
// reported ":unverified" and the reads are pure cost.
// desktop/paste-verification-policy.js is the memory that stops paying
// that cost; this module is what it switches off.
//
// The read bound was also, until now, fiction. `with timeout of N
// second` bounds an Apple Event sent BY the enclosing statement, and the
// old code placed it INSIDE `tell application "System Events"`, where it
// bounds nothing. Measured on macOS 27 against the Finder process, whose
// AXFocusedUIElement read is the pathological case the timeout was
// written for:
//
//   no timeout                                    -> still blocked at 20 s (killed)
//   `with timeout` INSIDE the tell block (old)    -> still blocked at 12 s (killed)
//   `with timeout of 0.25 second` AROUND the tell -> error -1712 after 286 ms
//   `with timeout of 2 seconds`   AROUND the tell -> error -1712 after 2044 ms
//   `with timeout of 0 seconds`   AROUND the tell -> no bound at all (killed at 10 s)
//
// So the timeout statement must wrap the `tell`, fractional values are
// honoured (0.25 s really is 0.25 s — it is NOT coerced to an integer),
// and 0 means "wait forever". Every read below is written that way.
