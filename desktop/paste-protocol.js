// SSOT for the paste wire protocol — the marker strings the paste
// scripts PRINT and the parsers READ.
//
// Every one of these was typed independently in two or three files:
// "SENT:" in paste-script.js and again as a literal inside
// paste-result.js's regex; "AXT:" in paste-script.js, again in
// paste-verification-policy.js's line matcher, and again in main.js's
// stream filter. Nothing resolved the duplicates, so renaming a marker
// in the script left every test green while the production parse went
// silently blind — and going blind on "SENT:" specifically means the
// ladder cannot tell "killed before the keystroke" from "killed after
// it" and pastes the transcript into the target a second time. That is
// the exact defect the receipt was introduced to prevent.
//
// Producers: paste-script.js (macOS AppleScript), the Windows VBS built
// in main.js. Consumers: paste-result.js, paste-verification-policy.js,
// main.js.
