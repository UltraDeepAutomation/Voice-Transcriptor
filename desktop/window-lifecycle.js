/**
 * Main-window lifecycle — every decision, in one place, with no Electron
 * in sight.
 *
 * Before this module the answer to "why did the window just disappear?"
 * was spread over nine mechanisms that each solved the previous one's
 * symptom: a reveal single-flight promise, an 80 ms reveal-request
 * timer, a 2.5 s "reveal protection" dwell, an "expected hide" dwell, an
 * `app.show()` un-hide dance, a `shouldRevealMainWindowForActivate`
 * heuristic that inspected four window flags, an auto-hide when the
 * recording capsule appeared, an auto-hide when a stop was driven from
 * the main process, and a macOS `close` handler that hid the window
 * instead of closing it. Together they produced the boot signature the
 * user reported: `[main-window] event=show/hide` eight times inside
 * 200 ms.
 *
 * The replacement is a table. Every window transition the app can make
 * is one of three actions, and which one is a pure function of the event
 * and two booleans. The Electron side does what the table says and logs
 * one line per transition — nothing in the app is allowed to show, hide
 * or reorder the main window on its own.
 *
 * The product contract this encodes:
 *
 *   1. The process runs ⇒ the Dock shows the running indicator. Regular
 *      activation policy, always; no accessory mode, no dock hiding.
 *   2. Clicking the app (Dock, Finder, `open -a`, tray) shows, focuses and
 *      maximises the window — zoomed to the display's work area, not into
 *      a macOS full-screen space. Saved bounds are restored only when the
 *      user has actually resized or moved the window; the default is
 *      maximised.
 *   3. The yellow button is a native minimise. The app keeps running:
 *      global hotkeys, recording capsule, backend. A Dock click restores it.
 *   4. Closing the window (red button, Cmd+W) and Cmd+Q both quit — on
 *      every platform. "Closed" means "not running".
 *   5. Nothing else moves the window. The recording capsule in particular
 *      is a separate, non-focusable, always-on-top panel: it never hides,
 *      focuses or reorders the main window.
