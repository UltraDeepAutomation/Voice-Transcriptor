# ── Why this module logs ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every remote transcription and upscale call passes through here, and
# none of it was recorded. A retry is invisible latency: a user whose
# upload took eight seconds because the provider returned 429 twice sees
# only that it was slow, and the support log agreed with them — it had
# nothing to say about why.
#
# Worse, the two paths that give up have real consequences the log never
# mentioned. A read timeout on a POST is abandoned deliberately, because
# the provider may already have done (and billed) the work; and a final
# failure after N attempts becomes a user-facing error whose history —
# how many attempts, how long, against which status — existed nowhere.
#
# Retries are logged at INFO (they are normal, and bounded). Giving up is
# WARNING, because that is what a support reader is looking for.
