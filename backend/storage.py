"""Shared atomic-write primitives — the SSOT storage layer.

Every persistent file written by the backend goes through one of these
helpers. The goals are uniform and non-negotiable across call sites:

    1. ATOMICITY — the final file either has the OLD contents or the
       FULL NEW contents. There is no intermediate state. We write to
       a unique tmp file in the target's directory and ``os.replace()``
       in a single syscall.

    2. DURABILITY — contents are ``fsync()``'d to storage BEFORE the
       rename lands, so a kernel/power crash cannot leave an empty
       file visible at the target path. On POSIX we also ``fsync()``
       the parent directory so the rename metadata itself is durable.

    3. CRASH RECOVERY — ``rotate_backup()`` copies the current file to
       a ``.bak`` sibling BEFORE a mutating write. If the new write is
       corrupt (bug, truncation, bad migration) the caller's read
       path can fall back to ``.bak``.

    4. TEMP-FILE HYGIENE — tmp names use ``<target>.tmp-<hex>`` which
       matches the convention ``_sweep_orphan_tmp_files`` in
       backend.main expects, so a crash mid-write does not leave
       permanent clutter.

    5. SINGLE IMPLEMENTATION — NO caller opens a final persistent file
       for write directly. JSON / text / bytes writes and already-written
       tmp-file promotions route here. This keeps fsync semantics,
       tmp-naming conventions, and error handling identical across the
       whole codebase, so a future improvement (say, async writes or a
       different tmp location under a ramdisk) is a one-file change.

The helpers raise ``OSError`` on any failure. They clean up the tmp
file before re-raising so no half-written artefact lingers.
