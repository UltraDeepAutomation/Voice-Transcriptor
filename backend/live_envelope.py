"""The ``final`` WebSocket envelope — ONE shape, ONE constructor.

Why this module exists (B-038)
------------------------------
``{"type": "final", ...}`` is the single message the renderer delivers a
transcript from: since the "one owner of the text" change the backend
envelope IS the transcript, and the renderer's only remaining decision
is whether an envelope arrived at all. That message used to be written
out by hand at five call sites in ``backend.main`` in THREE mutually
incompatible shapes:

* the Deepgram drain — ``text/segments/durationSec/source/stats/
  uncoveredSpeechSec/streamedSec/coveredEndSec``;
* the local assist — ``text/segments/durationSec/source`` plus FLAT
  ``complete/coveredSec/totalSec/droppedSec/uncoveredTailSec`` and none
  of the four diagnostics above;
* the two error paths (no API key, connect failure) — a third subset,
  one of them with the diagnostics and one without.

The renderer's parser then had to be a union of the three, and every
field added on one side was a silent no-op on the other. This module is
the answer: every ``final`` message is built HERE, so there is exactly
one shape on the wire and every key is always present.

The shape
---------
Every key below is ALWAYS present. Absence is expressed by a value
(``""``, ``0.0``, ``null``), never by a missing key, because a missing
key is indistinguishable from a version mismatch — and a version
mismatch read as a fact is how a "complete" coverage report gets
believed for a session that never reported one.

===================== ========================================
``type``              always ``"final"``
``source``            who read the audio: ``deepgram-live`` or
                      ``local-assist`` (the constants below)
``text``              the delivered transcript, verbatim
``segments``          committed segments, each carrying its own
                      ``words`` and ``source``
``durationSec``       how long the transcript IS (last segment end)
``coveredEndSec``     how far a DECODER reported (never an interim)
``streamedSec``       audio actually handed to the provider
``uncoveredSpeechSec`` speech still not covered after recovery
``error``             ``""`` when the stop succeeded
``stats``             always an object — see ``live_final_stats``
``coverage``          the local assist's window report, or ``null``
                      for a transport that has no notion of windows
===================== ========================================

``coverage`` is ``null`` rather than absent for the same reason: the
renderer's adoption policy (``frontend/src/live-coverage.ts``) refuses
to adopt a transcript whose coverage it cannot read, and "the field is
null" and "this build does not send the field" must not be two
different-looking answers to that question.

The mirror of this module on the other side is
``frontend/src/live-envelope.ts``. Neither is allowed to drift: the
committed fixture ``contracts/live-final-envelope.json`` is PRODUCED by
this module's builder in ``backend/tests/test_live_envelope.py`` and
CONSUMED by ``frontend/tests/live-envelope.test.ts``, so a field added
or renamed on one side fails the other side's suite.
