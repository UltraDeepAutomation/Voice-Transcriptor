"""Every remote call passes through the retry helper, and none of it was
recorded.

A retry is invisible latency. A user whose upload took eight seconds
because the provider answered 429 twice sees only that it was slow, and
the support log agreed with them — it had nothing to say about why.

Two paths matter more than the rest. A read timeout on a POST is
abandoned deliberately, because the provider may already have done — and
billed — the work; and a final failure becomes a user-facing error whose
history (how many attempts, how long, against what) existed nowhere.

These tests pin the record, not the retry policy, which
``request_with_retry`` already owned and this change does not touch.
