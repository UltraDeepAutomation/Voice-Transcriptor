"""Ending things: cancellation, control frames, and the stop's ordering.

Three defect shapes that all live in teardown code, where nothing is
observed unless it is asserted:

* ``except (asyncio.CancelledError, Exception): pass`` — thirteen sites
  that named cancellation deliberately (it is a ``BaseException``, so a
  bare ``except Exception`` would not catch it) and then discarded it,
  along with every real failure inside the task;
* ``asyncio.wait_for`` around ``ws.send`` for the three CONTROL frames,
  after the same module had documented cancelling a ``websockets`` send
  mid-frame as the cause of a run of production hangs and removed it
  from the audio path;
* a second reading cancelled and never awaited, and a warm-socket swap
  allowed to run alongside the finalize it is about to pull the socket
  out from under.
