"""``CloseStream`` must not race the transcript ``Finalize`` flushes.

Both frames used to be written in the same millisecond, so the stream
could be torn down before Deepgram returned the audio that Finalize had
just flushed. Measured across 14 sessions in one main.log: sessions whose
last segment arrived naturally (``speech_final=true``) left 0.25 s of
audio undecoded on average, while sessions still mid-utterance at Stop
(``speech_final=false``) left 1.86 s — the clause the user had just
spoken. That is the difference the user described between "it ended
exactly where I stopped" and "the last sentence is missing".

``finalize()`` now waits for the flushed transcript before closing,
bounded by ``FINALIZE_FLUSH_WAIT_SEC`` and short-circuited the moment it
arrives.
