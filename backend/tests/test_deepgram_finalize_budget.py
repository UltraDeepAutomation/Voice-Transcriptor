"""The post-Finalize wait, and what actually ends it.

Measured over 410 real stops in main.log: 267 (65 %) ended with the
streamed audio ALREADY fully covered by finalized segments and burned
the full ``FINALIZE_FLUSH_WAIT_SEC`` ceiling anyway — 608 s of stop
latency, almost all of it here. The conclusion drawn at the time was
that Deepgram answers such a Finalize with nothing, and two shorter
ceilings were sized on that conclusion.

It answers. The answer to "Finalize with nothing buffered" is an
``is_final`` carrying an empty transcript, and it was being deleted by
the empty-text guard at the top of ``_process_deepgram_message``, above
the is_final branch, so it armed nothing (B-005). The 608 s measured a
bug in this backend, not a silent provider.

So there is ONE ceiling again, and the wait ends on Deepgram's answer
rather than on a timer: words, or the empty final that says there are
none. Coverage is still measured before the wait, because it decides
whether a RETRY is possible and therefore what worst case the renderer
is told to expect.
