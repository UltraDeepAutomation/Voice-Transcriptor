"""Ending a task we started, without ending the coroutine that waits.

Why this is a module and not four lines at each call site
--------------------------------------------------------
``asyncio.CancelledError`` inherits from ``BaseException``, not from
``Exception`` — so ``except (asyncio.CancelledError, Exception): pass``
is not a broad catch that happens to include cancellation. It names
cancellation deliberately and then discards it. Thirteen places in this
backend were written that way, all of them ``pass``, and every one had
the same two consequences:

* the cancellation of the coroutine DOING THE AWAITING was swallowed.
  Five of those sites sit in the WebSocket handler's ``finally`` block,
  so a handler cancelled by uvicorn's shutdown or by a dropped
  connection carried on to the end as if nothing had happened, while
  the lifespan's 1 s budget for releasing sockets ran out around it;
* any real failure inside the task — a socket that would not close, an
  exception in a background loop — vanished without a log line, which
  is the "ownerless error" class AGENTS.md §1-2 forbids.

The distinction the idiom lost is between the cancellation of THAT
TASK, which is what we asked for and is not news, and OUR OWN, which
must propagate. Telling them apart needs two questions rather than one,
because cancelling a coroutine that is awaiting a task cancels that
task as well — see ``await_cancelled``.

The same module also owns the closing of a control frame's socket
(``send_without_cancelling``), because that is the same question one
level down: a write we must not interrupt, bounded by something other
than cancelling it.
