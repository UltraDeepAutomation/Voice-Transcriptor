"""What a configured language means to each Deepgram endpoint. One owner.

"auto" is a word from this app's UI, not from Deepgram, and the two
endpoints answer it differently — which is a fact about Deepgram, not a
choice this project gets to make:

* the LIVE (streaming) endpoint has no ``detect_language``. Nova-3
  offers ``language=multi``, a single multilingual model, and that is
  what "auto" has to become there;
* the PRERECORDED endpoint does have ``detect_language``, and it is the
  better reading there: it identifies the language of the whole file and
  decodes with that model, where ``multi`` was measured (2026-09-03, on
  the trilingual evidence recording) to drop Russian clauses.

So the two really are different, and the point of this module is that
the difference is written down ONCE, with its reason, instead of being
an unexplained divergence between two files — ``remote_deepgram`` said
``detect_language=true`` and ``remote_deepgram_live`` said ``multi``,
and nothing in either connected them.

The exception, and why it is not one: the recovery pass
(``backend.deepgram_recovery``) re-decodes spans of a LIVE recording
through the prerecorded endpoint, and it deliberately passes
``resolve_live_language`` — because it is repairing a reading the live
stream made, and a hole must not come back in a different language than
the transcript around it.
