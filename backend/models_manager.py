"""Local model download management (Settings → Models).

SSOT for "is this local ASR model present on this machine":

* faster-whisper variants live in the Hugging Face cache; presence is
  detected via ``huggingface_hub`` (already a transitive dependency of
  faster-whisper, so no new package);
* GigaAM weights are managed inside its own package cache — from the
  app's perspective the whole ENGINE is the unit, so a GigaAM entry is
  "downloaded" exactly when the engine imports.

Downloads run on a daemon thread with per-file progress; state is kept
in-process (a restart forgets transient progress but presence detection
above is authoritative anyway).

    * a download for that id is in flight — deleting the cache under a
      running ``hf_hub_download`` produces a half-written repo that
      ``whisper_downloaded`` would then report as absent while the worker
      keeps writing into it.

    Also evicts the model from the in-process transcription cache. Without
    that, a model deleted from disk keeps serving transcriptions from RAM
    until the backend restarts, while the UI shows it as not downloaded —
    two answers to "is this model available", which is exactly the drift
